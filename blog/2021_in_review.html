<h1>My work in 2021</h1>
<p>
    Work done is meaningful. Our lives are defined mostly the work we do. Work is a representation of us.
    Work is us, We are work. When I look back and try to recapture the year, it all seems hazy and i seem 
    not to know where the year has gone. Feels like my days were stolen from me.
    <br>
    But when I contenxtualize the thoughts and frame it along with my work. The fog clears to 
    noon day.

    The year began with a Covid injuduced lockdown which restricted my mobility. I 
    had voluntarily fork lifted some stress onto my brain in the form of projects and it was time to work
    The imobility came to the rescue with a pinch of motivation to have two four hour work sessions just
    like Lex Fridman. I managed to work on:

    <a href="#">Tomato Disease Detection</a>

    <a href="#">Blockchain Land Registry</a>

    <a href="#">Farming App</a>

    <a href="#">Advertising App</a>

    <a href="#">Services Purchasing App</a>

    About half way through the year, I changed cities to, in my opinion the best most beautiful in Zimbabwe.
    A lot of work in react-native and python helped me to secure a new job in the new city. It was nothing
    new, I had worked on the project during my internship. I naturally blended in because I was aware of
    the environment I was getting into.

    Four months in, another duty arose and I went back to Harare. I missed my family and friends to be
    honest.
