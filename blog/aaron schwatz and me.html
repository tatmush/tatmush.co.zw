    <h1>Aaron Swartz and Me</h1>

    <p>
        The story was first introduced to me in 2017 I suppose, by one of my good teachers in university. We were
        studying Cyber Laws and Ethics course which I never knew was a discipline. We read the story and 
        watched the documentaries as a class exercise, so i really had no option. Unbeknown to me the story stuck.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today I decide to tell my version. It reads like a tale. Its striking and saddening.<br>
        I do not understand it. There is a love of Aaron that just turns in me. Its common to romanticize the dead, especially if you are shona, nothing suprising here.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe its the nature of writing and not the story, but i severely doubt. It has to be the story. It is the story.<br>
        I will do little to no effort in narration of this great movie story but rather draw from a well stirred within. You can read his story here (a recent version i have read) -> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/03/11/requiem-for-a-dream">Requiem for a Dream</a>. I would not recommend starting with that one though. It is for us who have already fallen in love and heart broken.

        <h2>Unfinished projects</h2>
        <p>
            The fact that Aaron would start and not finish a project resonates with me. It is common among developers to start projects and leave them because interest has peaked. I have done just about a bit of everything and really have not pursued to be in the top 10%. I'm only skilled and experienced enough to learn more from an expert and ask the right questions or give guidance to an inquisitor. But with that, sometimes i struggle to really discover what i really want and end up digging a mile wide and an inch deep. Weather this is good or bad i do not know.

        <h2>Blogger</h2>

        <p>
            I remember my first attempt at blogging at around 11 or 12. I was graced enough to encounter a computer at a tender age by Zimbabwe standards. Clutching the innocence of a kid, i poured out my heart in writing into that microsoft word document. I did not really know what blogging was, but i knew that somewhere out there people were writing their experiences and sharing their lives. <br>
            In my novice adventures I penned one, only to find nasty comments at the bottom from my Dad. I know he felt sadistic in that moment. But he isn't one, the opposite rather. <br><br>

            I deleted it.<br>He discouraged me.<br>I never bothered again.<br>Until i was around 15 and we were discussing a blogging idea with a high school friend, Benson, over facebook i think. He was a bright kid. We all were. <br>
            That dream didn't materialize.<br>
            There were several deaths and resurrections and now is another.<br>
            I guess you can do what you are only meant to do.
        </p>
        <h2>Annoyed by Computers</h2>
        <p>
            I think I wrote somewhere about my academic journey. How I never knew IT as a discipline until 2015.<br>
            2020 I graduated. <br>
            2021, hitherto I loved IT.<br>
            Coding and hacking and WiFi was life. Now? Life is something else, another me would argue money but I shall not entertain the thought for my Christian person.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            I realize that technology is a part that enables and effects change.<br>
            Social skill is another.<br>
            Currently,  I'd rather learn to sell, market, talk to people to convince than learn Go. I'd rather learn how to manage than discovering a Zero-Day.<br>
            Although it would be nice, but it wouldn't give as much satisfaction.<br>
            Technology is a part. Social skill is a part. It is a great realization that draws me towards learning anthropology or psychology.<br><br>
            A mile wide, inch deep hole.

        <h2>Freedom</h2>
        <p>
            I am a firm believer that information should be free. Information should not be sold. Give freely. I'm just a believer of values here. I will not argue. I will behold firm.
        </p>

        <h2>Suicide</h2>
        <p>
            A morbid way to conclude.<br>
            While I thought it was funny to ask people how they would kill themselves, I have never contemplated 
            doing so. I value life, I cherish it. I love living. I love the people around me and they have loved me.
