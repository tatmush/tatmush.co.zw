    <h1>Atomic habits Part 1</h1>
    <p>
        A few summaries of what I am learning from James Clear and his atomic habits.
        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        Repetition builds routine. Repeat, repeat repeat. The more you repeat the more you have evidence against yourself doubt. One of the greatest reasons why we never achieve is that we do not believe in ourselves. Self belief is a great part of achieving. I mean the world is already fighting against you. How many more bad actors do you want against you?

        Repetition builds that evidence. Evidence builds belief that I am an entrepreneur, I am a writer, I am a coder.

        <h3>Start small</h3>
        A problem with many small business owners or people who want to start businesses is that they want to own 100% of nothing rather than own 0.1% of 1 million (its 10,000). They want to remain in control of a non-existent business. Being the director of dreams but owning no asset.

        Reason is they do not want to start small. They blame the money, the rate, the system, the processes and cannot share with capable people to get business done.

        They over plan. Which the author calls motion. We want action and not motion. Motion is planning, organizing and researching to do something. It feels like progress but truly it is not. Its nothing. Action is the actual sales call. The actual sentence you wrote in your book. The actual painting you drew. That is action. 

        Action is more difficult that motion if you haven't noticed.

        <h3>Make it easy</h3>
        Make it easy to act. The first step to talking to a girl you like is saying hi. And you build from there. Go stand beside her. Its easy to say hi from there. Make it easy for yourself to do that thing that you intend to do.
